static is part of the declaration that allows you to keep local variables persistently. it is global but the scope of the name is only within the method.

Test using the same name outside the subroutine.

Must always check error return on system call for open:if the file descriptor is less than 0

assert is nice to use to halt code in debug to test stuff
